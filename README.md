At the moment, I'm
- getting the hang of 11ty with my [personal website](https://btrem.com/), including
      - javascript (.eleventy.js, filters, etc.)
      - YAML basics for front matter stuff
      - BrowserSync middleware
      - Nunjucks templating (which is pretty close to Jinja, so that at least is pretty easy)
- learning Python (still!)
- Jinja2
- still working with [simple SVG icons](https://github.com/btrem/svg-graphics)
- working with new CSS stuff, including
       - custom properties
       - flex
       - overflow word wrapping
- actively looking for work

When I'm not learning new web dev tricks, I'm in my urban
garden tending to herbs, tomatoes, radishes, kohlrabi, and
a bunch of volunteer squash plants whose origin is a mystery
to me.
