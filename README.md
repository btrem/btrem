At the moment, I'm
- getting the hang of 11ty
  - javascript (.eleventy.js, filters, etc.)
  - YAML basics for front matter stuff
  - BrowserSync middleware
  - Nunjucks templating (which is pretty close to Jinja, so that at least is pretty easy)
- working on my [personal website](https://btrem.com/)
- writing articles on svg, microformats, and the music of Lee Perry
- still working with [simple SVG icons](https://github.com/btrem/svg-graphics)
- working with new CSS stuff, including
    - custom properties
    - flex
    - overflow word wrapping

When I'm not learning new web dev tricks -- or working as a
server/bartender at my day job (ok, more often night job!)
I'm in my kitchen fermenting stuff.
Mostly vegetable ferments, but I occasionally attempt cider
and meade.

I'm also spend time gardening, concentrating on vegetables and fruits.
