At the moment, I'm
- getting the hang of 11ty
  - javascript (.eleventy.js, filters, etc.)
  - YAML basics for front matter stuff
  - BrowserSync middleware
  - Nunjucks templating (which is pretty close to Jinja, so that at least is pretty easy)
- working on my [personal website](https://btrem.com/)
- writing articles on svg, microformats, and more
- learning Python (still!)
- Jinja2
- still working with [simple SVG icons](https://github.com/btrem/svg-graphics)
- working with new CSS stuff, including
    - custom properties
    - flex
    - overflow word wrapping
- actively looking for work

When I'm not learning new web dev tricks, I'm in my kitchen
fermenting stuff. I have a batch of cider and meade that are
ready to bottle. And trying new vegetable ferments, too.

I'm also starting to think about gardening for the spring. It's
never too early to start planning. I have fava bean plants
that are already flowering.  (:
