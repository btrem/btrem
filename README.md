At the moment, I'm
- learning Python
- just picked up Jinja2
- started creating [simple SVG icons](https://github.com/btrem/svg-graphics)
- playing with new CSS stuff (really digging CSS variables)
- actively looking for work

When I'm not learning new web dev tricks, I'm in my urban
garden tending to herbs, tomatoes, radishes, kohlrabi, and
a bunch of volunteer squash plants whose origin is a mystery
to me.
